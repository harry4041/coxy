                Currently based in Cambridgeshire, I spend a lot of my time working on personal projects. These range from web pages
                to Unity games to even some more hands on, mechanical projects like fixing up motorbikes. Though I've never had a
                professional career working as a developer, that is what I am striving for. After all, they say if you love what you do
                you'll never work a day in your life.
